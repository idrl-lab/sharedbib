	abstract = {Temperature field inversion of heat-source systems (TFI-HSS) with limited observations is essential to monitor the system health. Although some methods such as interpolation have been proposed to solve TFI-HSS, those existing methods ignore correlations between data constraints and physics constraints, causing the low precision. In this work, we develop a physics-informed neural network-based temperature field inversion (PINN-TFI) method to solve the TFI-HSS task and a coefficient matrix condition number based position selection of observations (CMCN-PSO) method to select optimal positions of noisy observations. For the TFI-HSS task, the PINN-TFI method encodes constrain terms into the loss function and thus the task is transformed into an optimization problem of minimizing the loss function. In addition, we have found that noise significantly affect reconstruction performances of the PINN-TFI method. To alleviate the effect of noises in observations, we propose the CMCN-PSO method to find optimal positions, where the condition number of observations is used to evaluate positions. The results demonstrate that the PINN-TFI method can significantly improve prediction precisions and the CMCN-PSO method can find good positions to improve the robustness of the PINN-TFI method.},

	abstract = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been widely used to solve various scientiﬁc computing problems. However, large training costs limit PINNs for some real-time applications. Although some works have been proposed to improve the training efﬁciency of PINNs, few consider the inﬂuence of initialization. To this end, we propose a New Reptile initialization-based Physics-Informed Neural Network (NRPINN). The original Reptile algorithm is a metalearning initialization method based on labeled data. PINNs can be trained with less labeled data or even without any labeled data by adding partial differential equations (PDEs) as a penalty term into the loss function. Inspired by this idea, we propose the new Reptile initialization to sample more tasks from the parameterized PDEs and adapt the penalty term of the loss. The new Reptile initialization can acquire initialization parameters from related tasks by supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning. Then, PINNs with initialization parameters can efﬁciently solve PDEs. Besides, the new Reptile initialization can also be used for the variants of PINNs. Finally, we demonstrate and verify the NRPINN considering both forward problems, including solving Poisson, Burgers, and Schro¨dinger equations, as well as inverse problems, where unknown parameters in the PDEs are estimated. Experimental results show that the NRPINN training is much faster and achieves higher accuracy than PINNs with other initialization methods.},
